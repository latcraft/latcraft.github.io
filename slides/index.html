background-image: url('why.jpg')
# .lighten[Why another community?]
???
- I don't want LatCraft to be "just one more community" or compare it to others and there is a reason for that:
- By comparing yourself with others it's pretty hard to make huge leap forward or start doing things completely differently because your mind is driven by establishment. 
- If you really want to deliver fresh ideas and innovate the 1st think you must do is FREE UP YOUR MIND FROM HABIT.
- We are neither comparing ourself with others, nor competing against someone.

# .lighten[International]
???
- The 1st step towards internationality is holding events in ENGLISH.
- Why? 
- IT professionals from abroad on a permanent/contract basis. They are **part of Latvian IT community** as we are and we have to **keep them in the loop**.
- We want **international speakers**. Easier to bring, **understand what we're talking about** (same applies to **sponsors** and **partners**)
- Our BROADEST audience is not here, it's **ONLINE** - videos in english can **get murh more attention**.
- Obviously it makes thing complicated, but the **we never expected it to be easy**.

- We want you to stay here and speak. We want you to realize and improve your speaking potential, get momentum, go and attend international conferences as a speaker.
- We'll give **the best advice**, connect you with the right people, find suitable conference
- It doens't mean that LatCraft will look like X-Factor, all speaches will go through careful review, so we don't have to **compromise on quality** :)
