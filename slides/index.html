### Latvian Software Craftsmanship Community

# .lighten[Why another community?]
???
- Well, we have more than 100 participants, seems you'd love to have one more community.
- I don't want LatCraft to be "just one more community" or compare it to others and there is a reason for that:
- By comparing yourself with others it's pretty hard to make huge leap forward. If Apple would compare itself with Android, we'd never get iPhone. We are neither comparing ourself with others, not competing against someone. We're LatCraft. So let's start once again.

# .lighten[International]
???
- Events will be hold in english.
- - We have many IT professionals from abroad on a permanent/contract basis or travelling just occasionally. We want international speakers (let's say, someone from Amazon ;). We don't want language to be a barrier.
- - It gives us more chance to attract sponsors, partners and reach BROADER audience by sharing our videos online (have I just said that we'll share videos online? :). It's hard, but the we never expected it to be easy.

# .lighten[Launch-Pad for new speakers]
???
- We want you to stay here and talk. We want you to realize your speaking potential.
- We don't want you to stop here. We want you to go to international conferences, so LatCraft is a GATE and a launchpad. Well give the best advice. That's why english is a must-have
- We can be proud of many smart people working in Latvia. We want them to spread a word about our country.
- Without compromising quality :)

- Talks: Comprehensible &bull; Entertaining &bull; Practical &bull; Portable talks
- Practical - no bullshit bingo, in other words.
- Portability from 2 perspectives - talks for many roles - IT, Software Development, People, Leadership; no language-specific FRAMEWORKS.
- Besides, event will have a particular subject and a single problem domain. What subject do we have today? :)
